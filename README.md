### Summary
This app was inspired when I was living alone for the first time and had to cook for myself. I bought myself chicken and when I was going to cook it, it was to my disappointment to find out it was expired. During my first internship I had the pleasure of working with Android Studio and XCode, so for this project I decided to create an Android App. Since there were already so many expiry date tracker in the play store, I wanted to mine simple and easy to use.

The main features of this app includes
1. Free software, no ads are displayed in the app.
2. Easy and intuitive UI, allowing most to pick it up and use it.
3. Notifications, allowing users to use their food before it expires.
